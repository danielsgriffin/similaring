# similaring
A script for monitoring and logging similar webpages for a set of URLs.


- This uses Metaphor's Python SDK: [`metaphor-python`](https://github.com/metaphorsystems/metaphor-python)
- I started with their [Metaphor API Guide - Python SDK GPT](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-njpmDX0NE-metaphor-api-guide-python-sdk), but its pretty simple.
    - This is linked to from Metaphor's documentation: [Metaphor > Docs > Getting Started > GPT-assisted implementation](https://docs.metaphor.systems/reference/getting-started#gpt-assisted-implementation)
- You will need an API key.

Tell me if you have any questions or suggestions!

I discuss this and show some results on this page: [Similaring: Monitoring and Logging similar searches with the Metaphor API](https://danielsgriffin.com/pposts/2023/11/17/similaring/)
